# Python Library

This directory contains the Python library for reading and writing X4DF. The `setup.py` file can be used to create a 
wheel or egg file containing the code, however the simpler way to integrate the code into you project is just to copy
the `x4df.py` file into your code base since it's designed to be standalone. Other utility files may be added later but
these will not be strictly necessary to read and write X4DF.
